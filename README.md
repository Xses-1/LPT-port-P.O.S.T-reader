# LPT-port-P.O.S.T-reader


So, you got that 486 laptop from early '90s and you wanna play those old school DOS games, but of coures, the machine is not booting, probably BIOS battery, but you wanna cheack annyway. You go online and can't find any LPT / Parallel port / Printer port power on self test codes readers, beacuse it is ancient technology and you are living in Europe. That's why that project exists.
